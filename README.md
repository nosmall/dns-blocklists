## :zap: DNS-Blocklists: *For a better experience on the internet*

#### :cyclone: Allowlist <a name="allowlist"></a>
*The [Allowlist](allowlist.txt) contains incorrectly blocked domains that limit functionality*

#### :cyclone: Disallowed Clients <a name="disallowedclients"></a>
*This is a [list](DisallowedIPs.txt) of unusually strange and/or presumed hostile IP addresses that thought it'd be a good idea to port scan or otherwise mistreat my publicly accessible AdGuard Home server, without having anything even close to a good reason for doing so.*
